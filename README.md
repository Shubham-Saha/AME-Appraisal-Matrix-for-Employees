# AME-Appraisal-Matrix-for-Employees

                                    Introduction
In companies or organizations HR department works a lot at a time of appraisal.
Because it is a hard task to identify which employee is well suited for the
appraisal. All things are done by hands-on the department head officers.
Sometimes unfair decision is been taken by them, because by their some
mistake a eligible employee misses his/her appraisal. This may lead to a loss of
that company or organization when that employee leaves from his/her work. To
solve this problem the only way is to use an automated system which will predict
every employee’s appraisal automatically.
For this AME is introduced. What AME will do is minimize the work load of HR
department so that no more unfair may occurs and they can save their valuable
time on doing other important things for their working zone.

A. What is AME ?
AME is an automated system which is build to minimize the work load of
HR department. Basically AME is a machine learning based system which
is trained with a dataset and based on that dataset the system will predict
that a particular employee is eligible for appraisal or not by feeding it that
employee’s performance list. Dataset can be altered based on a company
or organization’s policy. As this is a proposed work so for this I have
created a dataset based on any company or organizations basic policy.
AME is build using machine learning algorithm named Support Vector
Machine algorithm, which is categorized as a Supervised learning’s
Classification Analysis.

B. What is Support Vector Machine algorithm ?
SVM stands for Support Vector Machine. It is a machine learning
approach used for classification and regression analysis. It depends on
supervised learning models and trained by learning algorithms. They
analyze the large amount of data to identify patterns from them. An SVM
generates parallel partitions by generating two parallel lines. For each
category of data in a high-dimensional space and uses almost all
attributes. It separates the space in a single pass to generate flat and
linear partitions. Divide the 2 categories by a clear gap that should be as
wide as possible. Do this partitioning by a plane called hyperplane. An
SVM creates hyperplanes that have the largest margin in a
high-dimensional space to separate given data into classes. The margin
between the 2 classes represents the longest distance between closest
data points of those classes. The larger the margin, the lower is the
generalization error of the classifier.
                           Working procedure & Implementation of AME
As it is mentioned before that AME is a proposed work. But the prototype which
is now working is build with machine learning’s SVM algorithm. This is
implemented in Python Programming Language. Here the dataset which I
manually created is trained in the SVM and after that some value to predict will
be added. Thus our predicted result will be shown. Below every steps of AME the
implement process is described. I have implemented this using Anaconda
Navigator’s Spyder environment.
